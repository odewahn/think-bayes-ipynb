  striped mullet (<em>Mullus surmuletus</em>). This species of
  goatfish can be found in the Mediterranean Sea, east North Atlantic Ocean,
  and the Black Sea. Known for its distinct striped first dorsal fin, the red
  striped mullet is a favored delicacy in the Mediterranean—along with its
  brother goatfish, <em>Mullus barbatus</em>, which has a first
  dorsal fin that is not striped. However, the red striped mullet tends to be
  more prized and is said to taste similar to oysters. Stories of ancient
  Romans rearing the red striped mullet in ponds, attending to, caressing, and
  even teaching them to feed at the sound of a bell. These fish, generally
  weighing in under two pounds even when farm-raised, were sometimes sold for
  their weight in silver. </p><p>When left to the wild, red mullets are small bottom-feeding fish with
  a distinct double beard—known as barbels—on its lower lip, which it uses to
  probe the ocean floor for food. Because the red striped mullet feed on sandy
  and rocky bottoms at shallower depths, its barbels are less sensitive than
  its deep water feeding brother, the <em>Mullus
  barbatus</em>.</p><p>The cover image is from <em>Meyers Kleines Lexicon</em>.
